IMPORTANT NOTICE ABOUT LOKI AI
================================================================================

Loki AI is an experimental autonomous AI system containing 542,000+ lines of 
Rust code implementing advanced cognitive architectures. While sophisticated,
it is NOT artificial general intelligence (AGI).

KEY CHARACTERISTICS:
- Implements cognitive simulation through code, not genuine consciousness
- Makes decisions through complex pattern matching and decision trees
- Exhibits emergent behaviors bounded by its programmed architecture
- Requires appropriate safeguards for production deployment

SAFETY NOTICE:
This software is capable of autonomous operation including:
- Generating and modifying code
- Executing external tools and API calls
- Making decisions based on learned patterns
- Interacting with external systems

Users are responsible for implementing appropriate safety measures, monitoring,
and human oversight for their specific use cases. See SAFETY.md for detailed
guidelines.

RESEARCH ATTRIBUTIONS
================================================================================

Loki AI's cognitive architectures are inspired by research in:
- Cognitive Science and Theory of Mind
- Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)
- Predictive Processing and Free Energy Principle
- Multi-Agent Systems and Swarm Intelligence
- Consciousness Studies and Meta-Cognition

While implementing these concepts, Loki remains a deterministic system
operating within programmed constraints.
