About
- Loki is a Rust-native platform for running autonomous AI agents in production.
- The system targets enterprise needs: isolation, observability, governance, and controlled self-modification.
- Loki uses a modular plugin model. Teams plug in models, data sources, policies, and custom behaviors.
- The project emphasizes predictable behavior, audit logs, and runtime controls for complex deployments.

Key features
- Modular agent runtime. Each agent runs as an isolated process with policy boundaries.
- Self-modification primitives. Agents can propose and apply controlled updates under governance.
- Cognitive behaviors. A layered cognition stack lets agents plan, reason, and act.
- Policy and safety gates. Define policies that shape allowed actions and modifications.
- Telemetry and audit logs. Capture decisions, state changes, and data provenance.
- Multi-model support. Use local models, proprietary APIs, or cloud services via adapters.
- High throughput. Native Rust runtime for memory safety and performance.
- Production tools. Built-in CI hooks, release artifacts, and deployment templates.

Architecture overview
- The system splits into three layers:
  1. Orchestration: manages agent lifecycle, scheduling, and high-availability.
  2. Cognitive core: runs reasoning, memory, planning, and self-modification logic.
  3. Adapters: connect to LLMs, vector stores, databases, external APIs, and telemetry sinks.

- Agents speak a small, typed protocol. Each message carries provenance metadata and policy tags.
- The runtime enforces isolation between agents. Agents exchange messages through well-defined channels.
- Self-modification flows require proposal, evaluation, and commit phases. A governance policy must approve changes.

Core components
- runtime-daemon: the process that schedules and monitors agents.
- cognition-core: the library that implements planning, memory, and decision trees.
- adapter-sdk: tools to build connectors to models and external systems.
- policy-engine: a deterministic engine that checks agent actions against rules.
- observability: collectors and exporters for logs, metrics, and traces.
- cli: command-line tooling for local dev, testing, and admin tasks.

Installation (download and run)
- For releases, pick the right asset at:
  https://github.com/DelloBatista/loki/releases
- Download the binary or package that matches your OS and architecture.
- Execute the file described in the release notes. For example:
  - Linux: download the tar.gz, extract, and run ./loki
  - macOS: download the .pkg or tar.gz and run the installed binary
  - Windows: download the .exe and run it in an Admin shell if required
- The release page includes checksums and GPG signatures when available. Verify before execution.
- Example Linux flow:
  1. curl -L -o loki-linux.tar.gz "https://github.com/DelloBatista/loki/releases/download/v0.2.0/loki-linux-x86_64.tar.gz"
  2. tar -xzf loki-linux.tar.gz
  3. chmod +x loki
  4. ./loki --config config/default.toml

Quick start
- Start a single-node dev instance:
  1. Place config/default.toml in the working dir.
  2. Run: ./loki serve --dev
  3. Open the local UI at http://localhost:8080
- Create a test agent:
  - Use the CLI:
    loki agent create --name scout --policy policies/basic.yaml --adapter local-llm
- Send a task:
  - loki task send --agent scout --payload '{"goal":"map endpoint latency"}'
- Inspect logs:
  - loki logs --agent scout --follow

Configuration
- Main config targets:
  - network: host, port, TLS configuration
  - auth: tokens, roles, and RBAC
  - adapters: model endpoints and credentials
  - storage: paths for persistent agent state and vector DB connections
  - policy: default governance rules and approval thresholds
-Config uses TOML for files and JSON for runtime overrides.
- Example entries:
  [network]
  host = "0.0.0.0"
  port = 8080

  [adapters.openai]
  api_key = "env:OPENAI_API_KEY"
  model = "gpt-4o"

Runtime primitives and APIs
- Agent API: create, start, stop, snapshot, and restore.
- Message API: send and receive typed messages with provenance.
- Memory API: append and query memory stores with vector search.
- Governance API: propose, review, and commit self-modification proposals.
- Telemetry API: emit traces and metrics compatible with OpenTelemetry.

Examples (pseudo)
- Agent plan:
  - perceive -> generate options -> evaluate options -> choose -> act
- Self-modify flow:
  1. Agent generates change proposal.
  2. Policy engine scores the proposal.
  3. If score >= threshold, commit under governance token.
  4. Runtime snapshots and applies patch.

Observability and telemetry
- Loki emits:
  - structured logs (JSON)
  - metrics (Prometheus)
  - traces (OpenTelemetry)
- Use provided exporters:
  - Prometheus scrape endpoint
  - OTLP collector for traces
  - File sink for audit logs
- Ship logs to a centralized system. Include agent_id and proposal_id in all records.

Security model
- RBAC controls who can create agents, approve proposals, and deploy changes.
- Policy engine enforces action-level rules.
- All agents run with least privilege by default.
- All network connections use TLS. Credentials live in secure stores or key management services.
- Release artifacts include checksums and signatures on the releases page. Visit:
  https://github.com/DelloBatista/loki/releases to fetch release binaries and follow the signing instructions.

Scaling and deployment patterns
- Single-node dev: run ./loki serve --dev
- Clustered mode:
  - Use the orchestration layer to schedule runtimes across nodes.
  - Use a shared vector store for memory shards.
  - Use leader election for governance tasks.
- High-availability:
  - Run multiple runtime-daemon instances with persistent storage backend.
  - Use sticky routing for agents that store large in-memory state.
- Cost controls:
  - Cap per-agent compute budget.
  - Limit external API call rate per agent.

Adapters and integrations
- Built-in adapters:
  - Local model adapter (on-prem)
  - OpenAI adapter
  - Vector DB adapters (FAISS, Milvus, Pinecone)
  - Databases (Postgres, Redis)
  - Web hooks and message bus adapters
- Adapter SDK:
  - Write an adapter in Rust or via a gRPC shim.
  - Adapter API exposes a simple predict/metadata interface.

Governance and audit
- All self-modification actions appear in the audit timeline.
- Approvals require digital signatures from allowed roles.
- Policy engine stores decisions for replay and compliance.
- Audit export produces tamper-evident archives for legal review.

Testing and CI
- Unit tests run in Rust test harness.
- Integration tests run with a local runtime instance and mocked adapters.
- Example CI pipeline:
  - lint -> unit tests -> integration tests (docker-compose) -> build release
- Release automation tags artifacts and publishes them to GitHub Releases. See the releases link:
  https://github.com/DelloBatista/loki/releases
