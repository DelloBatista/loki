## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

Understanding Loki's architecture is crucial for contributions:

### Core Layers
```
1. Consciousness Layer (src/cognitive/)
   - 100+ modules for reasoning and decision-making
   - Critical for safety - changes require extensive review

2. Bridge Layer (src/tui/bridges/)
   - EventBridge, CognitiveBridge, MemoryBridge, ToolBridge
   - Ensures component communication

3. Memory Layer (src/memory/)
   - Hierarchical storage with SIMD optimization
   - Performance-critical code

4. Tool Layer (src/tools/)
   - External integrations
   - Must maintain security boundaries

5. Safety Layer (src/safety/)
   - Validation and monitoring
   - NEVER bypass safety checks
```

### Module Guidelines

#### When modifying cognitive modules:
- Document reasoning behind changes
- Add comprehensive tests
- Consider emergent behaviors
- Implement safety bounds
- Update relevant documentation

#### When adding new features:
- Follow existing architectural patterns
- Use appropriate abstraction layers
- Implement proper error handling
- Add monitoring/metrics
- Consider performance impact

## üìè Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Rust Standards
```rust
// Follow Rust 2025 best practices
// Use structured concurrency
use tokio::sync::mpsc;
use std::sync::Arc;

// Comprehensive error handling
use anyhow::{Result, Context};

// SIMD where appropriate
#[cfg(target_arch = "x86_64")]
use std::arch::x86_64::*;

// Type safety with custom types
pub struct GoalId(String);
pub struct MemoryId(String);
```

#### Formatting
- Use `rustfmt` with project settings
- Line width: 100 characters
- Cognitive complexity limit: 25

#### Naming Conventions
- Modules: snake_case
- Types: PascalCase
- Functions: snake_case
- Constants: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

### Commit Messages

Follow conventional commits:
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Test additions/changes
- `docs`: Documentation
- `safety`: Safety enhancements
- `cognitive`: Cognitive system changes

Examples:
```
feat(reasoning): add probabilistic inference engine
fix(memory): resolve SIMD alignment issue on ARM
safety(validation): add bounds checking for goal priorities
cognitive(consciousness): enhance meta-cognition feedback loop
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Requirements

### Critical Safety Rules

1. **Never Remove Safety Checks**
   ```rust
   // ‚ùå NEVER DO THIS
   // self.safety_validator.validate(action).await?;
   
   // ‚úÖ ALWAYS VALIDATE
   self.safety_validator.validate(action).await
       .context("Safety validation failed")?;
   ```

2. **Bound All Recursive Operations**
   ```rust
   // ‚ùå Unbounded recursion
   fn process(&self) {
       self.process();
   }
   
   // ‚úÖ Bounded with safety
   fn process(&self, depth: u32) -> Result<()> {
       if depth > MAX_RECURSION_DEPTH {
           return Err(anyhow!("Max recursion depth exceeded"));
       }
       // ...
   }
   ```

3. **Resource Limits Required**
   ```rust
   // All autonomous operations must have:
   - Timeout mechanisms
   - Memory bounds
   - API call limits
   - CPU usage caps
   ```

### Cognitive Module Safety

When modifying cognitive modules (`src/cognitive/`):

1. **Document Behavioral Changes**
   ```rust
   /// SAFETY: This modification changes decision-making behavior
   /// Previous: Conservative threshold (0.8)
   /// New: Adaptive threshold (0.6-0.9)
   /// Impact: More dynamic but requires monitoring
   ```

2. **Add Safety Tests**
   ```rust
   #[test]
   fn test_reasoning_bounds() {
       // Test edge cases
       // Test resource limits
       // Test timeout behavior
       // Test error conditions
   }
   ```

3. **Implement Safeguards**
   ```rust
   pub struct ReasoningEngine {
       max_chain_depth: u32,      // Prevent infinite chains
       confidence_threshold: f64,  // Minimum confidence required
       timeout: Duration,         // Maximum processing time
       safety_validator: Arc<SafetyValidator>,
   }
   ```
