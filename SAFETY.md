# üõ°Ô∏è Loki AI Safety Guidelines

## Overview

Loki AI is an experimental autonomous AI system with 542,000+ lines of code implementing cognitive architectures. While not AGI, its complexity and autonomous capabilities require responsible deployment.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Safety Information

### What Loki IS:
- **Sophisticated Automation**: Advanced pattern matching and decision trees
- **Cognitive Simulation**: Models inspired by human cognition and thermodynamic principles
- **Tool Orchestration**: Parallel execution of external tools
- **Learning System**: Accumulates patterns and improves over time


## üö¶ Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Use Cases ‚úÖ
- Development assistance and code generation
- Testing and documentation generation
- Research into cognitive architectures
- Educational exploration of AI systems
- Prototype development

### Medium Risk Use Cases ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Production code review and analysis
- Automated customer support (with oversight)
- Content generation for public consumption
- Data analysis and pattern recognition
- Integration with business workflows

### High Risk Use Cases ‚ùå
- Medical diagnosis or treatment decisions
- Financial trading without human oversight
- Legal advice or document generation
- Safety-critical system control
- Autonomous weapons or surveillance
- Child-facing applications without supervision

## üîí Security Considerations

### API Key Management
```bash
# Never commit API keys to version control
# Use environment variables or secure vaults
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."  # ‚ùå Don't hardcode
source .env                      # ‚úÖ Use env files (gitignored)
```

### Network Security
- Loki makes external API calls to LLM providers
- Implements OAuth for social media integration
- Uses HTTPS for all external communications
- Consider firewall rules for production deployments

### Data Privacy
- Loki may send user inputs to external LLM APIs
- Memory system stores conversation history locally
- Consider data retention policies
- Implement appropriate access controls

## üéØ Deployment Guidelines

### Development Environment
```bash
# Safe for experimentation
cargo run --example consciousness_demo
./target/release/loki tui
```

### Staging Environment
- Implement rate limiting on API calls
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, API costs)
- Use dedicated API keys with spending limits
- Enable comprehensive logging

### Production Environment
**Required Safeguards:**
1. **Kill Switch**: Ability to immediately halt autonomous operations
2. **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and API call quotas
3. **Audit Logging**: All actions logged with timestamps
4. **Human Review**: Critical decisions require approval
5. **Rollback Plan**: Ability to revert to previous versions

### Example Production Configuration
```yaml
# loki-production.yaml
safety:
  max_autonomous_actions: 100
  require_approval_for:
    - code_deployment
    - data_deletion
    - external_api_calls_over_$10
  resource_limits:
    max_memory_gb: 32
    max_cpu_cores: 8
    max_api_calls_per_hour: 1000
  monitoring:
    alert_on_anomalies: true
    log_all_actions: true
    retention_days: 90
```

## üß† Cognitive Module Safety

### Reasoning Engine Safeguards
- Confidence thresholds for decision-making
- Fallback to human review for low-confidence decisions
- Bounded reasoning chains to prevent infinite loops
- Timeout mechanisms for all cognitive operations

### Memory System Boundaries
- Maximum memory size limits
- Automatic pruning of old memories
- No storage of sensitive personal information
- Encryption for persistent storage

### Goal Management Constraints
- Goals must be explicitly approved
- Priority limits to prevent resource monopolization
- Dependency validation to prevent conflicts
- Progress monitoring and timeout enforcement

## üìä Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track
```rust
// Critical metrics for safety monitoring
pub struct SafetyMetrics {
    pub actions_per_minute: f64,
    pub api_calls_per_hour: u64,
    pub memory_usage_gb: f64,
    pub reasoning_chain_depth: u32,
    pub confidence_scores: Vec<f64>,
    pub error_rate: f64,
    pub human_interventions: u64,
}
```

### Alert Conditions
- Unusual spike in API calls
- Memory usage exceeding 80% of limit
- Error rate above 5%
- Confidence scores consistently below 0.7
- Reasoning chains exceeding depth 10
- Unauthorized tool execution attempts

## üö® Incident Response

### If Unexpected Behavior Occurs:

1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Stop the cognitive system
   pkill -f "loki cognitive"
   
   # Disable autonomous operations
   export LOKI_AUTONOMOUS=false
   
   # Review logs
   tail -f ~/.loki/logs/cognitive.log
   ```

2. **Investigation**
   - Check recent code modifications
   - Review reasoning chains and decisions
   - Analyze memory state for corruption
   - Examine external API interactions

3. **Recovery**
   - Revert to last known good configuration
   - Clear corrupted memory stores if necessary
   - Restart with increased monitoring
   - Document incident for community learning

## ü§ù Community Safety Collaboration

**Remember**: Loki is a powerful tool. Its outputs are generated through sophisticated pattern matching and should always be reviewed by humans for critical decisions. The appearance of reasoning, creativity, or consciousness is emergent from complex code and thermodynamic cognitive principles, not human cognition.

**When in doubt, add more safeguards.**
